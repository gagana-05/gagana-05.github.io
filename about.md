<h4> ...Hello there! </h4> 
<p>Oh you wanna know about the author, Umm firstly thanks for clicking up and secondly I don't have much to say. 
I always wanted to have a space where I could share all the cool stuff I enjoy doing and ofcouse yap. Ah yes, I am a 21 year old artist from India. I am more of a traditional artist and love sketching using brush pens, right now peak interests are in caricature and 2-D animation (bought myself a graphic tablet recently XD). I actually appreciate digital artists' more than ever now, coz it ain't easy. </p>

<p>Thanks for passing by <3</p>
<p> Also if you have time and want to connect on any of the social media please do so. </p>
